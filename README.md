# Image_Text_Extraction

The "Text Extraction from Images" project focuses on automating the process of extracting textual information from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. OCR enables computers to recognize and convert text content found within images or scanned documents into machine-readable text. 

In this project, we develop a software solution that accepts image inputs and processes them to identify and extract text. We utilize popular libraries such as OpenCV and pytesseract to handle image preprocessing and text recognition tasks. 

The key components of the project include:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: We apply techniques like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and image enhancement to optimize the image for OCR.

2. **Text Recognition**: We use pytesseract, a Python library, to recognize and extract text from the preprocessed image.

3. **User Interface**: We provide a user-friendly interface where users can upload images and obtain extracted text.

4. **Generalization**: The system is designed to work with various types of images, such as photographs, scanned documents, and screenshots, ensuring versatility.

Applications of this project are widespread, including data entry automation, document digitization, and content extraction from images. It simplifies tasks that involve extracting textual information from visual content, improving efficiency and accuracy in numerous domains.
